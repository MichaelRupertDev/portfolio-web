## Projects
### Docker Terminal

During my internship at Workiva, I became very familiar with Docker and its uses. In my free time, I started using Docker to spin up some of my favorite self-hosted services, such as a Mumble server, a Bitlbee server, and a few different web frameworks. One problem that I had however, was that it was a pain to SSH into the VPS that I was using to spin up/down services. As a result, over a weekend I built this, Docker Terminal. It uses a Flask backend to interface with the Docker cli, which allows me to display running containers, kill them, and or start new containers. I hope to rebuild it using React components in the near future.

### Websocket Interactive Whiteboard
This is a project that a partner and I wrote for a Web Design course during our Sophomore year at Iowa State. It uses NodeJS, Express, and Socket.IO to implement an interactive whiteboard where many users can draw shapes and text. It uses websockets to push updates out to connected clients, and supports as many users as the host machine and framework can handle.
